github actions a la https://github.com/nikolawannabe/aocgen/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-badges.yml

look into some automation to tie AOC_SESSION to github actions secret, or vice versa. maybe leverage the CLI `gp env ...` to set the gitpod variable from the pod terminal.
    github actions secrets prob aren't available to gitpod? set from workspace via script calling the API?

gitpod-recommended VSCode extension `premparihar.gotestexplorer` is apparently not available. do i need a test extension for this project?

figure out how to deal with single-package per year function collisions. EG parseLine() for day 2 & day 3.
    this kind of duplicate name is almost guaranteed? how to work around it? parseLine03() is just... ugly

get rid of the horribly obnoxious `// Code generated by aocgen; DO NOT EDIT.` in the files i'm supposed to be editing!

get rid of the trailing blank line in the downloaded input file
