github actions a la https://github.com/nikolawannabe/aocgen/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-badges.yml

look into some automation to tie AOC_SESSION to github actions secret, or vice versa. maybe leverage the CLI `gp env ...` to set the gitpod variable from the pod terminal.
    github actions secrets prob aren't available to gitpod? set from workspace via script calling the API?

gitpod-recommended VSCode extension `premparihar.gotestexplorer` is apparently not available. do i need a test extension for this project?

figure out how to deal with single-package per year function collisions. EG parseLine() for day 2 & day 3.
    this kind of duplicate name is almost guaranteed? how to work around it? parseLine03() is just... ugly

get rid of the trailing blank line in the downloaded input file

build/incorporate generic tree type in common
