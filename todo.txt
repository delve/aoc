github actions a la https://github.com/nikolawannabe/aocgen/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-badges.yml
look into some automation to tie AOC_SESSION to github actions secret, or vice versa. maybe leverage the CLI `gp env ...` to set the gitpod variable from the pod terminal.
    github actions secrets prob aren't available to gitpod? set from workspace via script calling the API?
gitpod-recommended VSCode extension `premparihar.gotestexplorer` is apparently not available. do i need a test extension for this project?
